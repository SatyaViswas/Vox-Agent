/**
 * scripts/sample/deep-read-gate.ts
 * R2.1 + W9-07/W9-09 — mandatory LLM deep-read REFUSAL predicate + auto-expand +
 * too-thin guard.
 * Type A — Pure Script (deterministic; NO clock/random/LLM/I-O).
 *
 * THE CORE R2.1 INVARIANT: a fresh run that read ZERO traces with the LLM and has
 * NO prior signals to lean on MUST be REFUSED. Tier-0 alone can only MEASURE cheap
 * signals (latency, error counts) — shipping a diagnosis off Tier-0 only is the
 * exact methodology blind-spot Wave-6 fixes. Fail-loud, never graceful-degrade.
 *
 * REFUSE  ⟺  llmReadCount === 0  &&  !priorSignalsRef
 *   - llmReadCount: traces actually deep-read by the LLM this run.
 *   - priorSignalsRef (R2.3): a reference into the class-memory library. When a
 *     prior signal record exists for this entity, the refusal is DOWNGRADED to a
 *     proceed-with-note (library priors substitute for a fresh deep-read).
 *
 * --focus runs (R2.6) BYPASS the auto-pick but NOT the floor/caps and NOT this
 * refusal — a focused run with zero LLM reads and no priors is still refused.
 *
 * AUTO-EXPAND: when the representativeness confidence (R2.5) is below 70%, the
 * sampler should auto-expand the deep-read sample (pull more traces, re-prove)
 * UNLESS a cap already tripped. This module only decides; the caller acts.
 *
 * W9-07/W9-09 TOO-THIN GUARD: when population >= 1000 AND llmReadCount < 100, the
 * verdict carries a `tooThin: true` marker (laziness violation, R-AL-2). The run is
 * NOT refused (the existing zero-refuse spirit is preserved) but the renderer MUST
 * surface a warning banner. A `coverageWarning` string is also populated.
 *
 * W17-D2 SELF-DIAG EXEMPTION: the default self-diag mode reads the single ongoing
 * session (1 session = 1 trace). A population-coverage too-thin banner there is
 * meaningless, so `isSelfDiagSingleSession` SUPPRESSES the banner (records
 * `tooThinExempted: true` for the audit trail). The exemption is for the
 * single-session DEFAULT only — self-diag may target many sessions on request, in
 * which case the caller does NOT set the flag and the banner fires normally.
 *
 * W17-D2 SELECTION-LEVEL DISCOVERY (BLOCK D2): the R2.1 "must deep-read" invariant
 * is also enforced at the SELECTION path (not just report-level). Before PRIMARY
 * selection (PR-049), when an entity has NO prior findings AND NO valid ledger
 * digests, a deep-read discovery pass is MANDATORY — selection off Tier-0 frequency
 * alone is forbidden. See evaluateSelectionDiscoveryGate(). Fail-loud (PR-035).

// ── BLOCK D2: selection-level mandatory deep-read discovery ───────────────────
//
// The R2.1 invariant (PR-035) historically lived at the REPORT level
// (evaluateDeepReadGate): a whole run with zero LLM reads and no priors is refused.
// But PRIMARY signal selection (PR-049) is a SEPARATE decision point — the skill
// picks WHICH signal/finding to surface BEFORE the report-level gate is even
// evaluated. If that selection runs off Tier-0 frequency alone (matchCount) with no
// deep-read behind it, the methodology blind-spot R2.1 forbids has merely moved
// upstream. BLOCK D2 closes that gap: the "must deep-read" enforcement reaches the
// selection path.
//
// MANDATORY-DISCOVERY predicate (fail-loud, consistent with PR-035):
//   priorFindingsCount === 0  &&  validLedgerDigestCount === 0   → discovery REQUIRED
//
//   - priorFindingsCount:      approved findings already in the class-memory library
//                              for this entity (store.hasPriors equivalent count).
//   - validLedgerDigestCount:  cross-run deep-read digests that PASS the validity
//                              filter (foldValidDigests: analyzerVersion +
//                              entityFingerprint + TTL). A STALE/invalid digest does
//                              NOT count — it cannot substitute for a fresh read.
//
// When BOTH are zero, there is no prior evidence to lean on, so primary selection
// MUST be preceded by a deep-read discovery pass. When EITHER is non-zero the priors
// substitute (R2.3 spirit) and discovery is not forced — selection may proceed.
