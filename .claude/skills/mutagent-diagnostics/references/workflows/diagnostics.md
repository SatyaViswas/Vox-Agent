## Diagnostics DAG (quick-reference)

```
1. fetch traces (filtered)
   ↓
2. Tier 0 static scan (tier0-scan.ts)
   ↓
3. Dynamic-cluster or window-based slicing (slicer.ts)
   ↓
4. N parallel analyzers (≤5) — each gets a slice
   ↓
5. Aggregate findings (cross-analyzer dedup + cluster correlation)
   ↓
6. RCA layer (WHAT/WHY/WHERE + recursive whys + remedy chain)
   ↓
7. Render HTML report (render.ts)
   ↓
8. Emit report path → await operator markdown copy-back
   ↓
9. AskUserQuestion (final apply gate) → spawn ai-engineer → shared `mutagent-cli apply` (apply-worker retired, M9)
```
