 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Shared categorical constants + TypeBox contracts for the ADL OPTIMIZE stage —
 * the Eval-Driven-Development (EDD) loop (F18 closure + F19 variance-first).
 *
 * EDD is the ③ OPTIMIZE stage of the ADL: after the initial *build, the loop
 * drives spec ↔ impl ↔ eval to full green. Two findings live here:
 *
 *   F19 — VARIANCE-FIRST. The FIRST focus after the build is eliminating per-case
 *         VARIANCE (run each case ~N times; the verdict must stop flapping) BEFORE
 *         measuring accuracy over the full dataset. "Without stabilizing variance
 *         first, accuracy over big samples is wasted." (variance-gate.ts gates this.)
 *
 *   F18 — EDD CLOSURE. The evaluator (judge-only, EV-051 — it NEVER fixes) REQUESTS
 *         an AI-Engineer to amend the Agent / AgentSpec. The request carries the
 *         failing cases + the proposed remedy target (agentspec vs impl); the engineer
 *         amends; the suite re-runs. (change-request.ts is the structured contract.)
 *
 * This module is PURE — it holds only categorical constants + TypeBox shapes. No
 * clock / Math.random / network (coding-rules · C-PIN). The two consumer modules
 * (variance-gate.ts · change-request.ts) import from here.
 *
 * Kept in lockstep with schemas/edd-change-request.schema.yaml (the human shape).
