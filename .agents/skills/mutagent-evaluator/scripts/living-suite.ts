 * The cross-cutting monotonic-growth primitive shared by the eval-suite (the
 * discovered criteria / judges) AND the datasets (`*build-dataset` /
 * `*discover-dataset`). Its single invariant: a living artifact NEVER shrinks —
 * every entry once added is retained; appends only grow it.
 *
 * Generic over the entry type `T` + a caller-supplied `keyOf` so it serves any
 * keyed collection (DatasetCase by id, DiscoveredCriterion by id, …). Carries
 * provenance (a monotonically-increasing version + counts) WITHOUT a clock —
 * stamping `appendedAt` would break byte-identity (C-PIN), so provenance is a
 * pure counter. PURE — no clock / random / network; same (suite, incoming) →
 * same grown suite.
 *
 * Austerity: holds NO LLM reasoning, makes NO pass/fail decision — it is pure
 * set algebra with a fail-loud monotonicity guard. The dataset scripts route
 * their appends through `appendOnly` + `assertMonotonicGrowth` here.
