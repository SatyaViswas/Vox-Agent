/**
 * scripts/eval-engine.ts — the ADL EVAL-stage ENGINE FORK resolver (Type A — PURE).
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * F7 / F9 / F14. When the ADL `*build` stage hands the evaluator a freshly-built
 * agent, `*build-evals` / `*evaluate` must ASK which eval engine to implement:
 *
 *   - Path A `native-matrix` — mutagent NATIVE eval-matrix + LLM-judge SUB-AGENTS.
 *     HARD DEPENDENCY on a Claude-Code host (to spawn the judges). For a CODE
 *     framework target (Mastra/TS) it ALSO needs the built agent to EMIT
 *     logs/traces to a known sink for the judge to read (F9). The CC dependency +
 *     sink requirement are SURFACED in the menu (F7) — never discovered late.
 *   - Path B `code-written` — evals written in the TARGET'S OWN language
 *     (bun/TS for Mastra): deterministic code-checks + an LLM-judge call VIA SDK +
 *     eval-criteria checks. PORTABLE — no CC sub-agents, so a non-CC user is not
 *     trapped in the matrix (F14).
 *
 * The fork is TARGET-CONDITIONAL (F9): a code FRAMEWORK target may pick EITHER
 * engine; a `harness:*` target is native-only (there is no target language to
 * write portable evals into). This module is PURE DATA + gates — the
 * AskUserQuestion prompt and the actual codegen live elsewhere
 * (codegen-evals.ts). Subject-agnostic; no clock / random / network.
