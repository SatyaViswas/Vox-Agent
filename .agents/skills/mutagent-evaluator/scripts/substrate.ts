/**
 * scripts/substrate.ts — EV-050 judge-runtime selection.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTE (v0.2.0 rename): `substrate` → `judge_runtime` in config + the public API
 * (`resolveSubstrate`→`resolveJudgeRuntime`, `judgeForSubstrate`→`judgeForRuntime`).
 * The enum VALUES are UNCHANGED (`agent-dispatch`/`in-house`/`code-based`/
 * `user-framework`) and the EV-050 `Substrate` enum symbol (contracts/eval-types.ts)
 * is kept — only the config KEY + the two selector functions were renamed.
 *
 * The W1 DEFAULT judge-runtime is **agent-dispatch** (scripts/agent-dispatch.ts):
 * verdicts are produced by parent-session-dispatched eval-judge / error-analyst
 * leaf subagents reasoning on the HOST runtime (Claude Code, diagnostics-style
 * mass-dispatch) and read back from verdict FILES — the default path calls NO
 * provider SDK. The onboarding choice (PRD §7.9) stays a real fork; this picks
 * the DEFAULT the spine + dogfood build against, and STRUCTURES the rest as
 * seams rather than hardcoding any single transport:
 *
 *   - agent-dispatch (DEFAULT) → a verdict-file-backed JudgeInvoke; the LLM
 *                      reasoning happens in dispatched subagents on the host,
 *                      NOT in a script. Requires `verdictDir` (where the
 *                      dispatched subagents wrote their verdict files).
 *   - in-house       (OPTIONAL) → a live LLM JudgeInvoke (google-genai shape);
 *                      kept, not deleted — DEMOTED from default. For the CI /
 *                      code-based export path that wants a provider call.
 *   - code-based     → objective checks over tool outputs; runs WITHOUT an LLM
 *                      judge → judgeForRuntime THROWS (deterministic code).
 *   - user-framework → an EXPORT target (Vitest/promptfoo/Braintrust/…); the
 *                      evaluator emits to it at onboarding → not a live judge.
 *
 * Why agent-dispatch is the default (operator correction 2026-06-19): the
 * Evaluator's functions must be performed BY an Evaluator agent on Claude Code
 * itself, mass-dispatched for throughput (mirror diagnostics), NOT by a script
 * calling Gemini. In-house Gemini remains a real onboarding option (EV-050) but
 * is no longer the spine default. Model intent stays sacred either way — the
 * host's pinned model for agent-dispatch, the asserted provider model in-house.
